6.910A Design Thinking and Innovation Leadership for Engineers and 6.910B Design Thinking and Innovation Project are courses I took in Fall 2022 in which I learned and practiced desgin thinking and innovation. I designed and implemented with my teammates an online dating tool called Voice Connect through which users can choose to match or pass a potential date by listening to a person's profile and a short recording of that person's voice on Alexa. The final product report is in the "Voice Connect Product Report.pdf" and our implementation on Voiceflow can be accessed by navigating to https://creator.voiceflow.com/prototype/6369ba5d498050fbf3583b8f.
